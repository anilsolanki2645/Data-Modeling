# Data Modeling

This repository provides resources and examples for data modeling and schema design. It includes sample SQL tables and demonstrates how to establish relationships between these tables. The project is organized into directories, each focusing on different types of data modeling and schema design.

## Overview

This project focuses on creating and managing sample SQL tables and designing schema relationships. The goal is to illustrate how to structure and relate data effectively using different models and schemas.

## Directories

### Clinic_ER_Model (Oracle)

- **Description**: Contains the Entity-Relationship (ER) model for a clinic database, implemented using Oracle SQL.
- **Features**:
  - Tables for patients, doctors, appointments, and treatments.
  - Relationships between entities to manage patient records and medical history.

### Sales_Database_with_Star_Schema

- **Description**: Includes a star schema design for a sales database.
- **Features**:
  - Fact table for sales transactions.
  - Dimension tables for products, customers, time, and sales regions.
  - Demonstrates how to structure data for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and reporting.

### Social Network Database Schema

- **Description**: Provides a schema design for a social network database.
- **Features**:
  - Tables for users, posts, comments, and friendships.
  - Relationships to model social interactions and user-generated content.

### Youth_Tobacco_Survey__YTS__Data Data Modeling

- **Description**: Data modeling for the Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) dataset.
- **Features**:
  - Tables for survey responses, demographics, and tobacco use statistics.
  - Relationships to analyze and report on survey data.

## Usage

1. **Explore the Directories**:
   - Navigate to each directory to review the SQL tables and schema designs.
   - Each directory contains a `README.md` with details specific to that model or schema.

2. **Implement and Test**:
   - Use the SQL scripts provided to create tables and test relationships in your database environment.
   - Modify the schemas as needed to fit your use case.

3. **Visualize Relationships**:
   - Use ER diagrams or schema visualization tools to better understand the relationships between tables.

## Best Practices

- **Normalization**: Ensure tables are normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried columns to improve performance.
- **Constraints**: Use foreign key constraints to enforce relationships and maintain data consistency.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for each table and relationship to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
